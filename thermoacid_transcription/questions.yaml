task: >
  You have been given raw RNA-seq data from *Saccharolobus islandicus* cells which were made to begin the cell cycle during a 6 hour period treated with acetic acid.
  The samples were extracted at three specific time points:2 hours and 30 minutes (in M-G1 phase), 4 hours (in S phase),6 hours( in G2 phase.Using the provided fastq files, 
  answer the following.
